# Categorization with Wikidata

## Get data from Wikidata

My corpus is issues of the classics journal The Classical Quarterly. I know that most major journals have a wikipedia page, so I was curious to see what journals I could turn up in a wikidata query for journals on classics. I quickly found that this would not work because the categorization was not consistent. For example, they could be categorized as "academic journal", "history journal", "periodical", etc. Some journals did not have any other specific categorization to narrow to classics and so the search stopped there. When I did try to specify these searches to classics specific journals there was also a wide variation of categorization used. I could search for classics as a "major topic" or "academic discipline" or "field of work." I don't know which choice is necessarily best, but there is no standardization, which makes it difficult to produce more than one or two journals at a time with each variation of the search. Other issues arise, like classical philological and archaeological journals being categorized as "philology" and "archaeology" but no more specific than that.

I added the statement "main subject: classics" to the Classical Quarterly and Classical Journal wikidata. This seems to be the most common statement used to categorize journals in the field of classics.
